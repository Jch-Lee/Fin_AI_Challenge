# Document Organization Summary

## 📁 Document Sharding Complete

### ✅ Successfully Sharded Documents

All major documents have been sharded into modular sections for better navigation and maintenance:

1. **Architecture** → `/architecture/` (11 files)
   - High-level architecture, tech stack, components, APIs, workflows
   - Includes technical appendices for Distill-M 2 implementation

2. **Competition Info** → `/competition-info/` (English) & `/competition-info-auto/` (Korean)
   - Project goals, critical rules, specifications, submission guidelines
   - Bilingual support for international collaboration

3. **Pipeline** → `/pipeline/` & `/pipeline-auto/` (Korean)
   - Complete development pipeline with step-by-step criteria
   - Epic-based organization for project management

4. **요구사항정의서** → `/요구사항정의서/` (7 files)
   - Goals, requirements, technical assumptions, epic details
   - Comprehensive Korean documentation

5. **PROJECT_PLAN** → `/project-plan/` (6 files)
   - Development schedule, priority matrix, risk management
   - Daily checkpoints and success metrics

6. **DEVELOPMENT_LOG** → `/development-log/` (3 files)
   - Daily logs with future update templates
   - Continuous project tracking

7. **Git Workflow** → `/git-workflow/` (7 files)
   - Branch creation, development, PR process
   - Visual workflow diagrams

### 📂 Archive Location

Original documents moved to `/docs/archive/` for reference:
- Architecture.md
- Competition_Info.md
- Pipeline.md
- 요구사항정의서.md
- PROJECT_PLAN.md
- DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
- gitworkflow.md

### 📌 Kept As-Is

- **README.md** - Entry point documentation (78 lines, no sharding needed)

## 🎯 Benefits of This Organization

1. **Modular Structure** - Easy to find and update specific sections
2. **Better Navigation** - Index files in each folder for quick reference
3. **Version Control** - Smaller files mean cleaner diffs and easier reviews
4. **Parallel Work** - Team members can work on different sections simultaneously
5. **Load Performance** - Faster loading of specific documentation sections

## 📖 How to Use

Each sharded folder contains:
- **index.md** - Table of contents with links to all sections
- **Individual section files** - Focused content for each topic

To read documentation:
1. Start with the `index.md` in any folder
2. Navigate to specific sections as needed
3. Original documents are preserved in `/archive/` if needed

## 🔄 Future Maintenance

When updating documentation:
- Edit the sharded section files directly
- Update the index.md if adding new sections
- Keep archive folder for historical reference
